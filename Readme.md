### cbord official library.sketch

#### What is this?
This is the main design file for CBORD which is meant to be used as a linked Sketch App library. It contains symbols, text styles, and layer styles to aid in the construction of high-fidelity prototypes. It represents our commitment to normalize our design choices in a highly reusable way.  

#### Why use this?
If you are designing for a new project (via Sketch App), and you link the shared library to it, you will automatically have at your disposal all of CBORD's design thinking and components to quickly scaffold your new project. *FEEL THE POWER!!!*

#### How do I use this?
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Sketch App
- Git 

Simply clone this repo to any location on your machine. Then, open Sketch -> Preferences -> Libraries tab and select "Add Library". Go to the location that you cloned this repo to and select the "cbord official library.sketch" file. Congratulations! Now you can start using all of the text styles, layer styles, and symbols found within the library!
